Some test about FPS shooting and Ragdoll

This is just some test about FPS shooting and ragdoll animated movement.

The gun is shooting using Raycast and Rigidbody. The Raycast is telling the gun when triggered exacty where the bullet is supposed to go. Then the bulluet is instanciated and fastly send to the point detect by Raycast. So we can be precise and having the real bullet contact on bodies.

The animated buddy is not move by any artificialy added forces. His body is a ragdoll where the legs are following an animation. So every step is different and the movement and speed less predictable. When dead, our buddy fell on the ground as a real ragdoll.

You can find on the repository an export of the game and the Unity project.

All codes, models and animation are homemade.
